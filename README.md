# YasEngineGL

This procjet is my old second atempt to graphics programming. That was extremally hard to start learning graphics programming from Vulkan API so I abandoned it after year. Then I started developing YasEngine with OpenGL but I wasn't happy how some stuff is explained then I decided to go full software renderer and started engine YasEngineSoftware. And then started from drawing pixel using SDL. This year I finished my first simple game Beauty of Math and decided to add 3D rendering but it is hard to add this to current code base of YasEngineSoftware so I decided to use obviously only smart part of code from ther and to be easier focus on only renderer not game so I created project YasRenderer. And YasRenderer will be for some time my active project.




This version of YasEngine, the OpenGL version, it is just for learning purpose.
My assumption was that I will start learning from immediately from 3D.
But it is not a easiest way to start learning from 3D and Vulkan at the sime time.
And I want to understand everything from basics of rendering which nowadays are implemented by hardware.
So I moved again from this version of YasEngine to YasEngineSoftware where for some time I'm implementing software renderer.
