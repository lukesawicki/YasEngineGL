# YasEngineGL

**** ATTENTION! **** CURRENTLY WORKING ON YasEngine with software renderer. Currently, regulary updated repositorium is:
https://github.com/lukesawicki/YasEngineSoftware -->(The repository will be private until January 17, 2024)




This version of YasEngine, the OpenGL version, it is just for learning purpose.
My assumption was that I will start learning from immediately from 3D.
But it is not a easiest way to start learning from 3D and Vulkan at the sime time.
And I want to understand everything from basics of rendering which nowadays are implemented by hardware.
So I moved again from this version of YasEngine to YasEngineSoftware where for some time I'm implementing software renderer.
